## Loop Functions
* lapply : Loop over a list and evaluate a function on each element
* sapply : Same as lapply but try to simplify the result
* apply  : Apply a function over the margins of an array
* tapply : Apply a function over subsets of a vector
* mapply : Multivariate version of lapply
An auxiliary function split is also useful, particularly in conjunction with lapply.
