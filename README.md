## In general look at the documentation of APIs
- httr allows GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests if you are authorized
- You can authenticate with a user name or a password
- Most modern APIs use something like oauth
- httr works well with Facebook, Google, Twitter, Github, etc.

## Interacting more directly with files
. file - open a connection to a text file
. url - open a connection to a url 
. gzfile - open a connection to a .gz file
. bzfile - open a connection to a .bz2 file
. ?connections for more information
